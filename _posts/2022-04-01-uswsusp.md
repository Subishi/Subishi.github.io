title: Hibernating to a specified swap area
--- 

### Hibernating to a specified swap partition/swapfile.
Perhaps, you don't want to use SSD as a swap space for daily usage, but waking up from hibernation is too slow from hdd. 

There's surely some different way to achieve this, but I decided to use Âµswsusp (userspace software suspend).

it provides us with 3 tools: `s2ram`, `s2disk` and `s2both`.
It's not longer developed (last release was in 2011), as mostly it's not really needed. s2ram is supposed to help the suspend to be done correctly by doing various quirks. If you can suspend with `zzz` just fine, you probably don't need this.
Now, the glorious part of uswsusp is `s2disk`. it lets you choose the resume device, resume offset enable compression and encryption and other cool stuff. 
`s2both` performes s2disk and then suspends the device (just like `zzz -H`, that's called hybrid sleep by the way and is a cool thing to do when battery is low as it will wake up right away and in case you run out of the battery it will safely resume from the hibernation during the next boot)

But before I explain how to configure it we should set up swap areas:
```
$ cat /proc/swaps
Filename			Type		Size		Used		Priority
/dev/sdb7		partition	9101308		947336		10
/dev/sda2		partition	8802300		0			0
```
oh, hey I just remembered swapon without any arguments gets literally the -h output of /proc/swaps:
```
$ swapon
NAME      TYPE      SIZE USED PRIO
/dev/sdb7 partition 8,7G 943M   10
/dev/sda2 partition 8,4G   0B    0
```

a- Ukhm,
As you can see, one swap partition has a higher priority than the other and all memory pages get saved there first. (what leaves the other partition "untouched" or at last getting minimum I/O possible), Now, this can be achieved by mounting both swaps specifying their priority in fstab:
```
UUID=<UUID>	none	swap	sw,pri=10	0	0
UUID=<UUID>	none	swap	sw,pri=0	0	0
```

Another way is to simply mount it when needed, in fact `swapon` automatically sets up every new swap with lower priority. (on a flipside, setting priority to be the same for all swaps spreads the reads and writes evenly among them, that's like raid 0 for swaps  >W<).

Once we have added the swaps we can go ahead and create /etc/uswsusp.conf (if it's not present already). [Arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Uswsusp) is a great reference, although it uses suspend.conf instead.
Assuming you are using a swap parition, you can simply add:

`resume device = /dev/disk/by-uuid/<uuid>`

but if you are using a swapfile you need to first specify the partition and then add the offset (basically on which byte swap space starts). it can be obtained by running `swap-offset /mnt/randompath/swapfile`

```
resume device = /dev/disk/by-label/partition-with-a-swapfile`
resume offset = 7272727
```

some optional cool options are `compress = y` causing the saved image to be compressed with the LZF algorithm what saves the I/O and `encrypt = y` will ask for the passphrase before saving and loading the image. for other options you can refer to the uswsusp.conf manual.

It's worth noting that for `resume device` parameter you could simply use /dev/<nyaX> but the order can differ between the reboots, so it's better to use the /dev/disk/by-uuid/<uuid> format. 

after that you can simply use s2disk as root and enjoy the cool stats displayed on the eighth tty:
![s2both nyans](https://subishi.github.io/images/s2both-nyans)

For my usecase I created simple scripts

s2ssd
```
#!/bin/sh
s2both -r /dev/disk/by-uuid/<uuid of the swap partition on ssd>
```

s2hdd
```
#!/bin/sh
s2both -r /dev/disk/by-uuid/<uuid of the swap partition on hdd>
```

### b-but how to make it resume?
so.. how did I get this running on void.. well.. I don't really think this is a sane way to do this, but since I don't know what the mkinitramfs-tools are I just made `resume` binary to be executed as the first thing in the first stage of runit (/etc/runit/1), actually what it does is simply:
```
resume -r /dev/disk/by-uuid/<uuid of the swap partition on ssd>
resume -r /dev/disk/by-uuid/<uuid of the swap partition on hdd>
```
put right after the path is set. This way it tries to resume from the ssd first and then tries to resume from the hdd. It doesn't seem to make the boot time longer almost at all (at least I don't see any difference).

There are some reasons why this is a bad idea, but I'm not gonna list any of them (w).
